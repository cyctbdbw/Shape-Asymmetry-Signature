function[groupped_IDS,group_num,EV_num]=EV_groupping(IDScore)
%% This function take the mean of the identification score based on the harmonic eigen-group
%% (For more details, see Robinson et al. (2016) at https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27157788/)
%% the groupped_IDS is the mean of the identification score. 
%% For example, groupped_IDS(1) is the mean of the IDScore(2:4); the first EV belongs to the 0th eigen-group
%% IDScore is the identifiability score calculated from the identifiability_score.m
%% group_num is the number of the eigenvalue-groups within the IDScore.
%% EV_num is the last eigenvalue index in the group_num.
%% For instance, if the IDScore is from the first 1000 eigenvalues, group_num is 30, and the EV_num is 961, 
%% and groupped_IDS take the mean of these 30 groups independently.
